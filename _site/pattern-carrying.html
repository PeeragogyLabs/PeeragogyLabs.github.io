<p>One of the important maxims from the world of FLOSS is: “Given enough
eyeballs, all bugs are shallow” <span class="citation">[8]</span>. A
partial converse is also true: there’s only so much any one person can
do, since we all have limited time and energy.</p>

<p>How can we help prevent those people who are involved with the project
from over-promising or over-committing, and subsequently crashing and
burning? First, let’s be clear that there are lots of ways things can go
wrong. Simplistic expectations – like <em>assuming that others will do the
work for you</em> <span class="citation">[13]</span> – can undermine your
ability to correctly gauge your own strengths, weaknesses, and
commitments. Without careful, critical engagement, you might not even
notice when there’s a problem. Where one person has trouble letting go,
others may have trouble speaking up. Pressure builds when communication
isn’t going well.</p>

<p>Serious frustration is a sign that it’s time to revisit the group’s and
your own individual plan. Are these realistic? If you have a “buddy”
they can provide a reality check. Maybe things are not <em>that hard</em> after
all – and maybe they don’t need to be done <em>right now</em>. Generalizing
from this: the project can promote an open dialog by creating
opportunities for people to share their worries and generate an emergent
plan for addressing them <span class="citation">[10]</span>. Use the
project to make note of obstacles. For example, if you’d like to pass a
baton, you’ll need someone there who can take it. Maybe you can’t find
that person right away, but you can bring up the concern and get it onto
the project’s . The situation is always changing, but if we continue to
create suitable checkpoints and benchmarks, then we can take steps to
take care of an issue that’s getting bogged down.</p>

<p>Think of the project as an ecosystem populated by acts of participation.
As we get to know more about ourselves and each other, we know what
sorts of things we can expect, and we are able to work together more
sustainably <span class="citation">[6]</span>. We moderate stress and
improve collective outcomes by taking concerns seriously.</p>

<p>Guiding and rebalancing behavior in a social context can begin with
speaking up about a concern. When we acknowledge concerns, we must take
into account our own boundedness. We have find an opportunity to make
ourselves helpful, without impinging on others’ <strong>independence</strong>. This
doesn’t mean allowing all possible stresses to run rampant: we work to
stay within the realm of <strong>antifragility</strong>, where manageable stress
<em>improves</em> the system rather than degrading it <span class="citation">[12]</span>. As we share concerns and are met with
care and practical support, our actions begin to align better with
expectations (often as a result of forming more realistic expectations).</p>

<p>Wikipedia aims to emphasize a neutral point of view, but its users are
not neutral.<sup id="fnref:fn1"><a href="#fn:fn1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>
topics that matter to them.<sup id="fnref:fn2"><a href="#fn:fn2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>
and participation are not neutral in another less sanguine sense. More
information on Wikipedia deals with Europe than all of the locations
outside of Europe <span class="citation">[2]</span>. As we remarked in
the pattern, most of the actual work is contributed by a small
percentage of users. The technology limits the kinds of things that can
be said <span class="citation">[2]</span>. The total number of active
editors has been falling since 2007.<sup id="fnref:fn3"><a href="#fn:fn3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>
Some blame outmoded technology and an insider culture <span class="citation">[11]</span>, or a stringent editorial approach that
emerged in response to the site’s popularity <span class="citation">[3]</span>. Others highlight the rise of successful
competition, often inspired by wiki models, but driven by “corporate
logic” <span class="citation">[4,5]</span>. Some proposed solutions
focus on various indicators of “community health.”<sup id="fnref:fn4"><a href="#fn:fn4" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Progressive thinkers have for some time subscribed to the view that
“there shall be no women in case there be not men, nor men in case there
be not women” <span class="citation">[7]</span>. A separate Ladies
Hall seems entirely archaic. However, in light
of the extreme gender imbalance in free software, and still striking
imbalance at Wikipedia <span class="citation">[1,9]</span>, it will be
important to do whatever it takes to make women and girls welcome, not
least because this is a significant factor in boosting our .</p>

<p>Making it easy and fruitful for others to get involved is one of the
best ways to redistribute the load. This often requires knowledge
transfer and skill development among those involved; see ….</p>

<ul>
  <li>Can the tools we use talk with each other?</li>
  <li>2 parallel Jitsi chats</li>
  <li>Paola: If you have to teach this class to undergrads, what would be the product?</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s think about this relative to the outcomes of the course:</p>

<p>“By the end of the course, students will be able to synthesize interventions relevant to global economic challenges. They will gain design and media production skills relevant to creating a Massive Open Online Course. It is expected that students will also train the affective dimensions of their engagement with difficult issues, by practicing rigorous self-assessment and developing constructive feedback for their peers. Specifically, students successfully completing the course will build a portfolio of evidence that they can receive major challenges with compassion, respond with an awareness of diverse needs, value others’ perspectives and voices, organize effective networks and strategies, and characterize constructive collaborative efforts and ways to support them.”</p>

<p>We can also define our own desired outcomes, and analyse what’s our carrying capacity to complete the course and the project.
Discussing today w/ CO-OP uni people. How will we work with the students on our courses?
Paola is teaching a research methodology course, thinking about different kinds of outcomes that are not like the classic research report, but that are a bit creative.
So they are thinking about what they want to do.  So, e.g., create something like an installation or a performance.</p>

<p>Charlotte: How about clipping a successful/unsuccessful  outcome “moment” from a project? Identifying these moments and cataloging them sothey can be reproduced and re-used.</p>
