  <p>In the context of P2P-learning, a wiki platform can be a useful and
powerful collaboration tool. This section will help you understand
what a wiki is and what it is not, why you should use it, how to
choose a wiki engine and finally how you could use it in a P2P
context. Some examples of P2P-learning projects run on wikis will help
you see the potential of the tool.</p>

          What is a wiki? <a href="#what-is-a-wiki"></a>
        
        
      </h2>

<p>For <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_cunningham">Ward Cunningham</a>
father of the wiki, “a wiki is a freely expandable collection of
interlinked Web ‘pages’, a hypertext system for storing and modifying
information - a database, where each page is easily editable by any user
with a forms-capable Web browser client” <span>[</span>1<span>]</span>.</p>

<p>According to Wikipedia : “a wiki is a website whose users can add,
modify, or delete its content via a web browser using a simplified
markup language or a rich-text editor” <span>[</span>2<span>]</span>.</p>

<p>You can watch the CommonCraft video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dnL00TdmLY">“Wikis in Plain
English”</a> on YouTube to better
understand what a wiki is.</p>
    
      <h2 id="what-differentiates-the-wiki-from-other-co-editing-tools">
        
        
          What differentiates the wiki from other co-editing tools? <a href="#what-differentiates-the-wiki-from-other-co-editing-tools"></a>
        
        
      </h2>

<p>The previous definitions show that a wiki is a “website,” in other words
it is composed of pages that are connected together by hyperlinks. In
addition, every authorized person (not all wikis are totally open like
Wikipedia) can edit the pages from a web browser, reducing time and
space constraints. In case one saves a mistake, or for any other reason,
would like to go back to a previous version, a feature called “history”
allows users to see previous versions and to roll back to any of them. This
version history allows a comparison of versions that avoids the clutter
of the “commentaries rainbow” that we are used to in popular word
processors. For example, if you work on a wiki page and come back later, you will be able to catch up by comparing your latest version with the lastest version generated by someone else.</p>

<p>Tools like <a href="https://docs.google.com/">Google
Docs</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etherpad">Etherpad</a> are
design to enable co-editing on a single document. This can be seen as a
“wiki way” of working on a document as it is web based and includes
versioning. But it is not a wiki because a single document is not a
website. Those tools offer realtime collaboration which wikis do not and
are far easier for beginners to use as they work
in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> mode, which many
wikis do not support. However, the advanced features of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki_syntax">wiki markup
language</a> make it a more
powerful tool. In summary, tools like Googles Docs or Etherpad are a
great way to quickly collaborate (synchronously, asynchronously, or a
mixture of both) on a single document for free, with a low barrier to
entry and no technical support. (Note that Etherpad does have a
“wiki-links” plugin that can allow it to be used in a more wiki-like
way; <a href="https://hackpad.com/">Hackpad</a> is another real-time editing tool
that prominently features linking – and it claims to be “the best wiki
ever”.)</p>

<p>Using a real wiki engine is more interesting for bigger projects and
allows a huge number of users to collaborate on the same platform. A
wiki reduces the coordination complication as e-mails exchanges are no
more needed to coordinate a project. On the other hand it can help us
deal with complexity (<span>[</span>3<span>]</span>,
<span>[</span>4<span>]</span>) especially if you put basic simple rules
in place like the Wikipedia’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPOV">neutral point of
view</a> to allow every participant to
share her or his ideas.</p>

<p>Going back to the continuum we talked about before, some tools like
Moodle, SharePoint, WordPress, Drupal and others have built-in wiki
features. Those features can be good but will typically not be as good
for wiki-building purposes as a well-developed special-purpose wiki
engine. In other words, the main focus of those tools is not the wiki, which is
only a secondary feature. When you choose a real wiki engine
like <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/">Mediawiki</a>, <a href="http://www.tiki.org/">Tiki</a>, <a href="http://foswiki.org/">Foswiki</a>,
etc., the wiki will be your platform, not a feature of it. For example
if you start a wiki activity in a Moodle course, this wiki will be only
visible to a specific group of students and searchable only to those
students. On the other hand if your learning platform is a wiki, the
whole platform will be searchable to all members regarding their
permissions. We are not saying here that a wiki is better than other
tools but if you need a wiki engine to address your needs you may
consider going with a strong wiki engine rather than a “micro-wiki”
engine embedded in an other tool.</p>

          Why use a wiki? <a href="#why-use-a-wiki"></a>
        
        
      </h2>

<p>Those are the main reasons you should consider a wiki for your peer
learning projects :</p>

<ul>
  <li>To reduce cumbersome coordination issues by having a central and continually updated place to store your content. You will reduce     e-mail usage drastically, and have access to your content from anywhere, using any operating system.</li>
  <li>To keep track of the evolution of your project and be able to view
or roll back any previous version of a wiki page using the history
feature.</li>
  <li>To make links between wiki pages to connect ideas and people but
also make links to external URL’s. This last possibility is very
handy to cite your sources.</li>
  <li>To deal with complexity. As a wiki allows anyone to contribute, if
you set some easy rules like Wikipedia’s NPOV (Neutral Point of
View), you will be able to catch more complexity as you will allow
everyone to express his or her opinion. Wikis also integrate a forum
or comment feature that will help you solve editing conflicts.</li>
  <li>To deal with work in progress. A wiki is a great tool to capture an
ongoing work.</li>
  <li>To support transparency by letting every member of the community
see what all the others are doing.</li>
  <li>To support a network structure; as a wiki is in essence a horizontal
tool.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using a hyperlinks you can…</p>

  <p><strong>Gérard Ayache</strong>: “… jump by a single click from one network node to
another, from one computer to another, from one bit of information to the
other, from one universe to another, from one brain to another.”

          How to choose a wiki engine? <a href="#how-to-choose-a-wiki-engine"></a>
        
        
      </h2>

<p>You will find more than a hundred different wiki engines.</p>

<p>The first main distinction is between open source ones that are free to
download and commercial ones you will have to pay for. You will find
powerful engines on both sides, both open-source and commercial. Sometimes, the
open-source ones look less polished at first sight, but are backed by a
strong community and offer a range of customization possibilities. The
commercial wiki engines are sold as a package, nicely presented but often
offering less customization on the user side. Additional features or
custom-made tools will cost you extra.</p>

<p>The second distinction that we can make is between wiki farms and
self-hosted wikis. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki_hosting_service">wiki
farm</a> is a hosting
service you can find for both open-source or commercial wikis. The goal
of those farms is to simplify the hosting of individual wikis. If you
don’t want to choose wiki farm hosting, you will have to host the wiki
on your own server. This will give you more latitude and data privacy
but will require more technical skills and maintenance fees.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.wikimatrix.org/">Wikimatrix</a> web site will help you
choose the best wiki for your needs. It allows you to compare the
features of more than a hundred wiki
engines. Ward Cunningham’s list of the top 10 best wiki engines can be found on our <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TopTenWikiEngines">Peeragogy.org</a> site.</p>

<p>A wiki is a good tool for collaborative projects and especially suited for
work in progress, as you can easily track changes using the history,
compare those versions and, if necessary, roll back to previous versions. In
other words, nothing gets lost.</p>

<p>Here are some ideas about how to use a wiki in a peeragogy project :</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Use a wiki as your learning platform</strong>. It can also
support <a href="http://socialmediaclassroom.com/host/peeragogy/wiki/connectivism-practice-how-organize-a-mooc">Massive Open Online Courses
(MOOCs)</a>. A
wiki will help you organize your <a href="http://socialmediaclassroom.com/host/peeragogy/wiki/organizing-a-learning-context">learning
context</a>.
You can choose to give access to your wiki only to the project
participants or open it to the public
like <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>. Using hyperlinking, you
will operationalize the theory
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivism">connectivism</a> by
connecting nodes together. As a learning platform, wikis are powerful
because you can easily see what others are doing, share with them,
get inspired, merge ideas or link to ideas. In other words, it
fosters emulation between learners. For additional resources about
wikis in education, look on <a href="http://www.diigo.com/user/regisb/wiki%20education">Diigo</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Manage your peeragogy project</strong>. A wiki is an excellent tool for
project collaboration. Above all, the wiki can be a central place
for peer learners to write or link to content. Even if you use
several technologies to run your project as we did to write this
handbook, at the end of the day all the content can be centralized
on a wiki using direct writing on wiki pages or embedding hyperlinks. This way,
members can access the content from anywhere and from any device
connected to the internet, using any platform or application. They 
will always see the most recent version while being able to browse
through the version history to understand what has changed since
their last visit.</li>
  <li><strong>Publish your project</strong>. As a wiki is a website you can easily use
it to show your work to the world. Regarding web design, don’t
forget that a wiki can look way better than a Wikipedia page if you
customize it</li>

administer</li>
  <li><strong>Self-election</strong> – enable people to choose what they want to work
on, at their own pace, in their own way</li>
  <li><strong>Communication</strong> – use comment threads and talk pages to discuss
wiki changes</li>
  <li><strong>Documenting changes</strong> – most wikis enable editors to write very
brief descriptions of their edits</li>
  <li><strong>Rules</strong> – keep rules at a minimum level to avoid chaos without
constraining creativity</li>
  <li><strong>Fun</strong> – make it fun for people to contribute</li>
