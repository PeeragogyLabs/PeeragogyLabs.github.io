- Use the existing summaries to write a summary of the whole book
 - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zcsuvmky5cQmWlglO6lK1HYWsGR3xwlMePls-klLNZg/edit
- Write a short version of the handbook, following the outline below - this can be the "starter pack"
- Add a list of translations to the introduction here (Charlie)
- Other outcomes including papers, pointers to citations of this stuff in the literature...
- If you learn nothing else, what is one thing you can learn and use right away?
 
# Introduce the full outline of book

* 1. *Convene*. Review the intention: what do we expect to learn or make together? **Problem**
  *  _Mini-introduction to Peeragogy._
    * *What problem does peeragogy solve? Some history, where did the project come from?*
      - maybe putting a map in, to give some context -- like a concept map (ask Howard, find others) 
    * Our intention is to write a "How To Handbook" (how does this help address the problem).
    * How we have put things together here and how we are using the content...
    * Initial content could be based on [Peeragogy](http://peeragogy.github.io/pattern-peeragogy.html) pattern
    * Or on the [Starter Pack](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w2JZhpkrYYKknpJSSJgz23PPYxI31Cu1eWvw8I9ZraM/edit).
    * Could also incorporate a summary of the "Convene" section.
* 2. *Organize*. Establish what is happening: what and how are we learning?
  * Incorporate a summary of the "Organize" section
  * [Newcomer](https://hackmd.io/LvcaTX1pTESFTtAMXK8lIg)
  * [Heartbeat](https://hackmd.io/Z-ME-AU2R-203F31uig12A)

* 5. *Share*. What else should we change going forward? **What's Next**
  * Come up with a "Share" strategy and summarize it here. 
  * [Wrapper](https://hackmd.io/q5K5GstZTsqXTHrCRyYQJA)

# Old introduction

> We live where no one knows the answer and the struggle is to figure
> out the question. [1]

Welcome to the *Peeragogy Handbook*! We want to kick things off with a
candid confession: we’re not going to pretend that this book is perfect.
In fact, it’s not an ordinary book at all.

The adventure starts when you get out your pen or pencil, or mouse and keyboard, and begin marking it
up. It gets kicked into high gear when you join *Peeragogy in Action*.

You’ll find a lot of friendly support as you write, draw, or dance your
own peeragogical adventure. But first, what is *peeragogy*?

Peeragogy is a flexible framework of techniques for peer learning and
peer knowledge production. Whereas pedagogy deals with the transmission
of knowledge from teachers to students, peeragogy is what people use to
produce and apply knowledge together. The strength of peeragogy is its
flexibility and scalability. The learning mind-set and strategies that
we are uncovering in the Peeragogy project can be applied in classrooms,
hackerspaces, organizations, wikis, and interconnected collaborations
across an entire society.

The *Peeragogy Handbook* is a compendium of know how for any group of
people who want to co-learn any subject together, when none of them is
an expert in the particular subject matter – learning together without
one traditional teacher, especially using the tools and knowledge
available online. What we say in the *Handbook* draws extensively on our
experiences working together on the *Handbook* – and our experiences in
other collaborative projects that drew us here in the first place. The
best way to learn about peeragogy is to do peeragogy, not just read
about it. Towards that end, coauthors and fans of the *Handbook* have an
active Google+ community, conveniently called *Peeragogy in Action*. We
maintain a regular schedule of weekly meetings that you’re welcome to
join. The *Handbook* includes a short syllabus, which also called
“Peeragogy in Action”, and you can work through this with your own group as
you read through the book.

You’re warmly invited to combine your local projects with the global
effort, and get involved in making the next edition of the *Handbook*.
That doesn’t necessarily require you to do extensive writing or editing.
We’re always interested in new use cases, tricky problems, and
interesting questions. In fact, our view is that any question is a good
question.

In Section 4 of the book, in the Scrapbook pattern, we have a list of some of the ways in which the current edition of the Handbook
is *not perfect*.
