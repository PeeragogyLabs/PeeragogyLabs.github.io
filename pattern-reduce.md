## Reduce, reuse, recycle 

### Motivation 

This pattern can guide project participants in identifying and managing
available resources.

### Context 

In a peer production context, you are simultaneously “making stuff” and
building on the work of others.

### Forces 

> ![image](images/derivative.png) **Derivative**: you don’t have to do everything yourself!  
> ![image](images/sensemaking.png) **Sensemaking**: resources are useful only when you can make sense of them.  
> ![image](images/sharing.png) **Sharing**: your understanding gains robustness when you share with others.

### Problem 

Many projects die because the cost of
<span><span>[Reinventing the Wheel](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ReinventingTheWheel)</span></span> \[c2\]
is too high. However, this is just one possible symptom of overfocus on
a few priorities. Concerns may also arise if the project’s output is not
actually used by anyone.

### Solution 

“Steal like an artist,” and make it possible for other people to build
on your work too. In the Peeragogy project, we
have used off-the-shelf and hosted software suited to the task at hand
(including: Drupal, Google+, Google Hangouts, Google Docs, Wordpress,
pandoc, Github, ShareLaTeX). Early on we agreed to release our
*Peeragogy Handbook* under the terms of the Creative Commons Public
Domain Dedication (CC0), the legal instrument that grants the greatest
possible leeway to downstream users.<span class="marginnote"><https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/></span>
This has allowed us and others to repurpose and improve its contents in
other settings, including the current paper. Follow the steps indicated
by the keywords in the pattern’s title:

-   *Reduce* the panoply of interesting interrelated ideas and methods
    to a functional core (e.g. writing a book).
-   *Reuse* resources relevant to this aim, factoring in “things I was
    going to have to do anyway” from everyone involved.
-   *Recycle* what you’ve created in new connections and relationships.

### Rationale 

Clearly we are not the first people to notice the problems with
wheel-reinvention, including “missing opportunities, repeating common
mistakes, and working harder than we need to.”<span class="marginnote"><https://blog.wikimedia.org/2013/11/19/learning-patterns-new-way-share-important-lessons/></span>
As a guest in one of our hangouts, Willow Brugh, of Geeks
without Bounds and the MIT Media Lab, remarked that *people often think
that they need to build a community, and so fail to recognize that they
are already part of a community.*<span class="marginnote"><https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpyQfYVKfBI></span>
converted our old pattern catalog from the *Peeragogy Handbook* into
this paper, sharing it with a new community and gaining new
perspectives; could we do something similar again?

### Resolution 

Reweaving old material into **derivative** designs and new material into
existing frameworks, we build deeper understanding, and carry out
collective **sensemaking**. The project’s
<span><span>Roadmap</span></span> develops by making sense of existing
resources – including our worries and concerns. Often we only know what
these are when we attempt to **share** them. Drawing on a wide range of
resources boosts our collective <span><span>Carrying
capacity</span></span>.

### Example 1 

Contributors are encouraged to recycle existing works that are
compatible with the Wikimedia-wide Creative Commons
Attribution-ShareAlike (CC-By-SA) license.<span class="marginnote"><https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/15411/></span>
 Some sub-projects have been created purely to help
repurpose other existing works in this way.<span class="marginnote"><https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Mathematics/PlanetMath_Exchange></span>
On the downstream side, DBPedia is an important resource
for the semantic web, built by collating data from Wikipedia’s
“infoboxes.”<label for="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle">&amp;#8853;</label>
  <input type="checkbox" id="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"><http://wiki.dbpedia.org/></span>
themselves increasingly being populated automatically using information
from WikiData.<span class="marginnote"><https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page></span>
able to develop tools that reuse Wikipedia content in other ways.{% sidenote 'extensive-use-of-sidenotes' 'Silvan Reinhold. 2006. WikiTrails: Augmenting wiki structure for collaborative, interdisciplinary learning. *Proceedings of the 2006 International Symposium on Wikis*, ACM, 47–58.' %} {% sidenote 'ref2' 'Nathalie Henry Riche, Bongshin Lee, and Fanny Chevalier. 2010. IChase: Supporting exploration and awareness of editing activities on Wikipedia. *Proceedings of the International Conference on Advanced Visual Interfaces*, ACM, 59–66.' %} However, these research projects do not
always result in a tool that is accessible to day-to-day users.

### Example 2 

The knowledge resources and collaboration tools currently available
online are what make a low-cost, high-quality, formally-accredited
future university conceivable. However, the available resources are not
always as organized as they would need to be for educative purposes, so
peeragogues can usefully put effort into <span><span>Reduce, reuse,
recycle</span></span>’ing available resources into a functioning
university Library.

### What’s Next in the Peeragogy Project

Are there other educational resources and peeragogical case studies that
we could fold into our work? Can we recycle material from the *Peeragogy
Handbook* into a format that is easier to understand and apply?

- Examples of the hairdressers and rowing club folks: this doesn't exist in a vacuum. 
- Is there anything new here...?  Well, we are distilling what exists in the raw materials?
- Chris: With the pattern of Heartbeat, that has chimed with the Co-Operative university in terms of, where people are co-producing things, how to keep the momentum going.
- Charlotte: this happens a lot in my projects.
- Chris: Quite an interesting discussion, I liked what Lisa was saying about different beats for different contexts.  Almost having to fit a pacemaker.
- Charlotte: With the concert series, I would like to hand it over to someone else, but it's a bridge too far to document that and help people become stakeholders.
- ACMi, they have problems - he is really good at revving people up about projects, and showing them what they can gain from a completed project.
- E.g., I stared this studio production for publishing.  But it was too complicated to bring elements together.  Motivating volunteers, getting a core of volunteers that overlap.  So you can produce things at any point in time.
- Livestreaming is super easy!  It wasn't perfect because the people were on the beach with their phone.   But it is easy!  
- Is added value of TV station to make it more perfect, with better production values.  But it has way less volume, because you can't mount one every week.
- Chris: Stew and Cake: Livestream is a stew, everyone can contribute.  But a TV recording is much more of a cake, you need to plan the ingredients, bake it at a certain temperature.
- Cake mix, reheated curry, etc., it may not have everything you want.

Briefing: Johnathan was looking at Thinkhubub.  Lots of people online, you can react to the comments, the film maker can be online, maybe some from Co-Op group. The film is about the impact of modern slavery. It's kind of geared around co-production and responding to some of the material in a flipped manner.  Can continue the conversation elsewhere?

Schedule for 2PM and then we can pick this up. If it gets into the Calendar it can interpret it for any time.  This could be something that Jeff is interested in.

Next time: We will watch a film from https://aru.ac.uk/people/shreepali-patel - stay tuned for details.

We can learn from the experiments that others are doing, by joining in.  Maybe more peeragogical to join in, and look at what the measures of success are?
