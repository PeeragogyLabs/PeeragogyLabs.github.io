## Scrapbook 

### Motivation 

This pattern describes a way to make the project meaningful to your own learning and production enterprises.

### Context 

We have been working together for a while now. We have maintained and
revised our pattern catalog, and we are achieving some of the “What’s
Next” steps associated with some of the patterns.

### Forces 

> ![image](images/attention.png) **Attention**: due to limited energy, we need to ask: where should we set the focus?
> ![image](images/interest.png) **Interest**: new experiences catch our attention.
> ![image](images/meaning.png) **Meaning**: shared history makes things meaningful.

### Problem 

Not all of the ideas we’ve come up with have proved workable. Not all of
the patterns we’ve noticed remain equally relevant. In particular, some
patterns no longer lead to concrete next steps.

### Solution 

In order to maintain focus, is important to “tune” and “prune” the
things we give our attention to. We can connect this understanding to
any actions undertaken in the project by asking questions like these:

> \(1) Review what was supposed to happen. (2) Establish what is
> happening/happened. (3) Determine what’s right and wrong with what we
> are doing/have done. (4) What did we learn or change? (5) What else
> should we change going forward? <span class="citation">\[9\]</span>,
> after <span class="citation">\[10\]</span>.

Other review processes have been formalized, including the design review
in architecture and the postmortem in theater and other teamwork
settings <span class="citation">\[7,8\]</span>. The review process may
benefit from having an experienced facilitator on board <span
class="citation">\[6\]</span>. As current priorities become clearer, we
decide where to focus. Anything that isn’t receiving active attention
should be moved to a <span><span>Scrapbook</span></span>. This may
encompass:

-   *Retired patterns* that are tabled or completed (no more next steps);
-   *Proto-patterns* made of problems, issues, and concerns;
-   *A back-catalog* of publications, reports, or other artifacts.

In the Peeragogy project, alongside our patterns we initially maintained
a collection of antipatterns (like ‘<span><span>Magical
thinking</span></span>’) but the next steps coming from these seemed
particularly convoluted and abstract. So, we archived
them.[^fn1]
problems – without known solutions – right up front in the Introduction
to the *Peeragogy Handbook* <span class="citation">\[9\]</span>. Other
proto-patterns include ‘<span><span>Onboarding</span></span>’ and
‘<span><span>Don’t quit your day job</span></span>’, which arose in our
review of this paper (see “Emergent Roadmap”, below). Our back-catalog
includes academic papers <span class="citation">\[14\]</span> and a
thesis <span class="citation">\[5\]</span>. Everyone can maintain their
own personal <span><span>Scrapbook</span></span> as along with a
communal one. Furthermore, you don’t need to limit yourself to *your
own* creativity: include interesting ideas from other sources (see
<span><span>Reduce, reuse, recycle</span></span>). In some cases a
designated <span><span>Wrapper</span></span> may have to do further work
to elicit and organize contributions.

### Rationale 

We want to keep attention focused on the most relevant issues. If a
pattern, task, or concern does not lead to concrete “next steps” at the
moment, sufficient time for reflection may offer a better understanding,
and it may prove useful and actionable in a different context.

### Resolution 

Judicious use of the <span><span>Scrapbook</span></span> can help focus
project participants’ **attention** on current concerns, without losing
grasp of items of **interest**. The currently active pattern catalog is
leaner and more action-oriented as a result. If the
<span><span>Roadmap</span></span> shows where we’re going, it is the
<span><span>Scrapbook</span></span> that shows most clearly where we’ve
been, and collects the observations that are most **meaningful** to us.

### Example 1 

The history of the Wikimedia Foundation, and of Wikipedia, are
maintained as wiki pages.[^fn2]<sup>,</sup>[^fn3]
Wikipedia details outstanding issues, in the form of
critiques.[^fn4]
available to help facilitate the process of vetting proposed
fine-grained changes to articles.[^fn5]<sup>,</sup>[^fn6]
typically discussed at the Village Pump, and there are mechanisms in
place for settling disputes.[^7^]<sup>,</sup>[^fn8]

### Example 2 

Just as a university campus grows and changes over time, future
peeragogues will be drawn to new problems and patterns. They will trace
new paths and build new emergent structures (Figure \[christs-pieces\]).

### What’s Next in the Peeragogy Project

After pruning back our pattern catalog, we want it to grow again: new
patterns are needed. One strategy would be to turn the whole *Peeragogy
Handbook* into design patterns.  There are a number of other outstanding issues:

#### Maintaining a list of useful resources 

We include references and recommended reading in the *Handbook*, and
there are a lot more links that have been shared in the *Peeragogy in
Action* community.  It’s a ongoing task to catalog and improve these
resources – including books, videos, images, projects, technology, etc.
In short, let’s “Reduce, Reuse, Recycle”!  As a good start, Charlotte
Pierce has been maintaining a spreadsheet under the heading “survey” in
our Google Drive.

####  Developing a really accessible DIY tool-kit 

A short “workbook” containing interviews and some activities follows
this introduction, but it could be much more interactive. Amanda Lyons
and Paola Ricaurte made several new exercises and drawings that we could
include. A more developed workbook could be split off from the handbook
into a separate publication. It would be great to have something simple
for onramping. For example, the workbook could be accompanied by video
tutorials for new contributors.

Paola Ricaurte points out that a really useful book will be easy to
sell. For teachers interested in peeragogy, this needs to be something
that can be use in workshops or on their own, to write in, to think
through issues. We’re partway there, but to improve things, we really
need a better set of activities.

The next time Paola or someone else uses the handbook or workbook to run
a workshop, she can say, “turn to this page, let’s answer this question,
you have 10 minutes.” There are lots of places where the writing in the
handbook could be made more interactive. One technique Paola and Amanda
used was turning “statements” from the handbook into “questions.”

#### Crafting a visual identity 

Amanda also put together the latest cover art, with some collaboration
from Charlotte using inDesign. A more large-scale visual design would be
a good goal for the 4th Edition of the book. Fabrizio Terzi, who made
the handbook cover art for the 1st Edition, has been working on making
our website more friendly. So, again, work is in progress but we could
use your help.

#### Workflow for the 4th edition 

We’ve uploaded the content of the book to Github and are editing the
“live” version of the site in Markdown. For this and previous print
editions, we’ve converted to LaTeX. There are a number of workflow
bottlenecks: First, people need to be comfortable updating the content
on the site. Second, it would be good to have more people involved with
the technical editing work that goes into compiling for print. Remember,
when we produce an actual physical handbook, we can sell it. In fact,
because all co-authors have transferred their copyright in this book to
the Public Domain, *anyone* can print and sell copies, convert the
material into new interactive forms, or do just about anything with it.

#### Translations 

Translating a book that’s continually being revised is pretty much a
nightmare. With due respect to the valiant volunteer efforts that have
been attempted so far, it might be more convenient for everyone involved to
just pay professional translators or find a way to foster a multi-lingual
authoring community, or find a way to create a more robust process of
collective translation.  Ideas are welcome, and we're making some small
steps here.  More on this below.

#### Next steps? What’s the future of the project? 

In short: If we make the Handbook even more useful, then it will be no
problem to sell more copies of it. That is one way to make money to
cover future expenses. It’s a paradigmatic example for other business
models we might use in the future. But even more important than a
business model is a sense of our shared vision, which is why we’re
working on a “Peeragogy Creed” (after the Taekwondo creed, which exists
in various forms, one example is [2]). No
doubt you’ll find the first version on peeragogy.org soon! Chapter
[7](./distributed_roadmap.html) contains a further list of practical next
steps for the project.
